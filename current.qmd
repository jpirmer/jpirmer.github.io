üöß *This page is currently under construction. In the near future, I will share details about my research interests, ongoing projects, and how I approach research and teaching. For a small overview of ongoing projects see below.*

***

A large part of my research focuses on analyzing when and why certain modeling approaches succeed or fail, developing assumptions about performance, and testing whether the conditions under study provide the strongest possible insights.  

My current projects span several areas:
